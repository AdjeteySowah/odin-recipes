- This is a basic HTML project named odin-recipes. It's a recipe website.
- After completing this project I should be able to create a site with relative links(pages) and use a few HTML tags and attributes.
- I should be able to add some cool and basic styles.

<!-- I learnt how to use git commit without the message flag and the message itself.(just "git commit)
This allows you multiple lines of commit messages, usually 2 lines with a blank line separating them.
The first one is the action/change/fixes applied and the second is the reason. -->
